# Gargul
Looting made easy! If you use MS>OS (+1), soft-reserves, thatsmybis or simply want to auto-loot everything, so you can zug on, then look no further! Gargul can completely eliminate the need for group-loot if set up properly, check PackMule for more info (`/gl pm` in-game).

## Does everyone in the raid need Gargul?
No! For 99% of the features, only the loot master needs Gargul.

## When should I use Gargul?
- If you're the loot master in raids
- If you're using https://softres.it/ (see who reserved what, announce it in chat, double reserve support etc. etc.)
- Or If you're using https://thatsmybis.com/ (see wishlist/prio list info, item priority notes, export loot back into tmb, keep track of what was disenchanted etc. etc.)
- If you need an easy way to track rolls on items for both MS and OS
- If you need to keep track of +1 rolls
- If you're sick and tired of picking up loot in raids and want to keep going without having to enable group loot
